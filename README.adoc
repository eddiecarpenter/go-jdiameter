= Go Diameter Stack

This is a fork of the RestComm jDiameter Stack with a couple of enhancement done:

- Update the minimum java compatibility to Java 21
- Added support for Virtual Threading
- Removed use of Pico Containers
- Added Quarkus Extension
- Updated all the dependencies to latest versions

The project was only started in Jul 2024. The enhancement above is done but I still need to implement a CI/CD pipeline for the project and push the artifacts to a public repository.

== Virtual Threading

There is now a new parameter called "UseVirtualThreads" that if set to true will use virtual threads for the diameter stack.

In order to use virtual thread the minimum support Java version had to be change to Java 21.

== Quarkus Extension

The extension allows for the injection of configurations and stacks.
See the docs folder for the relevant documentation.
